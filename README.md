## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Hans** — a student at **Binus ASO School of Engineering**, currently pursuing a **Bachelor’s degree in Automotive Robotics Engineering**.

🚀 I'm passionate about learning **Robotics**, **IoT**, and all things **3D** — from design to printing. I'm also eager to deepen my knowledge in **ROS (Robot Operating System)** and **machine learning for Robotics**.

🔧 I frequently work with **Arduino**, **ESP32**, and **Raspberry Pi**, building smart automation and embedded systems.
🛠️ I regularly use **SolidWorks**, and I'm also familiar with **Inventor** and **Fusion 360** for mechanical design and prototyping.
💡 Always open to new ideas, collaborations, and opportunities to grow!
